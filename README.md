Take Home Test
==============

Introduction
------------
Was given a take home test to where I was provided several csv files.  And told to be able
to authenticate a user from the login.csv file, on login display the contents of the other files.
Obviously, some of the files have references to records in the other CVS file.

Installation
------------

You have to use composer, since it makes it easy installing the dependencies for this project.
There are a few files in conf/autoload, you will have to set up, for example, you will need to
set up your username and password and the database you will be accessing.  I have provided the
sql (database.sql) in the root directory.  I am also using memcache as well.
