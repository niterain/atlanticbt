Take Home Test
==============

Introduction
------------
Was given a take home test, and I was provided several csv files.  I was asked to authenticate a
user in the login.csv file.  And display the contents of the files to the person who is logged in.
I know, I paraphrased it.  I have  been refactoring things when I have had time, I still have some
TODO items.  But since there wasn't a comp provided, I went for basic divs everywhere.

Installation
------------

You have to use composer, since all of my dependencies are in the composer.json file.
There are a few files in conf/autoload, you will have to set up, for example, you will need to
set up your username and password and the database you will be accessing.  I have provided the
sql (database.sql) in the root directory.  I am also using memcached as well.
